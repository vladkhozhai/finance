fix: Add automatic payment method resolution to prevent transaction creation failures (Bug #36)

PROBLEM:
Users were unable to create transactions in production. The database requires
a payment_method_id (NOT NULL constraint from migration 20251219000001), but
the backend was allowing NULL values when users didn't select a payment method,
causing INSERT operations to fail with unclear error messages.

ROOT CAUSE:
- Database: payment_method_id has NOT NULL constraint
- Backend: Treated payment_method_id as optional, sending NULL
- Frontend: Allowed users to skip payment method selection
- Result: PostgreSQL rejected INSERT with constraint violation

SOLUTION:
Implemented automatic payment method resolution in createTransaction():

1. If user provides paymentMethodId → use it
2. If not provided → check for default payment method
3. If no default → use first active payment method
4. If none exist → auto-create "Cash/Wallet" with user's base currency

This ensures:
✅ All transactions have valid payment methods (satisfies DB constraint)
✅ Backward compatibility with existing frontend code
✅ Excellent UX for new users (no manual setup required)
✅ Clear error messages if payment method creation fails
✅ Multi-currency support maintained

CHANGES:
- src/app/actions/transactions.ts: Added payment method resolution logic
- src/lib/validations/transaction.ts: Updated documentation

TESTING:
✅ Build passes (npm run build)
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ No linting errors
✅ Backward compatible with existing transactions
✅ Auto-creates payment method for new users

DEPLOYMENT:
- No database migration required
- No breaking changes
- Ready for production deployment
